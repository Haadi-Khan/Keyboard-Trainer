#+title: Keyboard Trainer

Created this while learning Colemak-DH, but it's easy to use for any keyboard layout. Creates practice text to paste into MonkeyType custom practice mode.

In C++ because python's too slow and I was too lazy to install a Rust crate

* Compilation
#+begin_src bash
g++ --std=c++11 -o words words.cpp
#+end_src

Make sure to use versions >= 11

* Usage
=./words <characters>= yields a list of words which strictly contain the set of characters you enter.

=./words <characters> -r <characters>= filters to ensure that every word contains at least one of the characters in the required string. This is a good option when you want to specialize learning a key

** Example
#+begin_src bash
$ ./words ast
a at as sat stats ta stat

$ ./words ast -r s
as sat stats stat
#+end_src
